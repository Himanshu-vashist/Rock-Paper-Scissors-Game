# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a two-player hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V).
